# Introduction

UI System is a configurable, utility-first, design system for prototyping/building React applications.

Some key features:

- CSS-in-JS design system
- Only outputs the CSS that you use
- Intended to be customized to be _your_ design system

<SectionHeading>Getting Started</SectionHeading>

<Box
  id="asdf"
  className="mx-auto text-white rounded p-8 text-xl text-center w-full bg-blue-500"
>
  I'm a container
</Box>

The core of UI System is powered by the `<Box />` component. It serves as a composable UI primitive. `Box` components provide you with the following:

Just import `Box` to get started

```
import { Box } from "ui-system"
```

Now, use it like you would use any other React component. Let's use it to make a button.

```
<Box is="button" className="bg-black text-white rounded-full py-2 px-6 shadow">
  A Button
</Box>
```
