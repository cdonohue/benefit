```bash
npm i benefit
```

`createBenefit` is a function that will return a `styleWith` property that you can call as a function. Use this when you want to output any utility classes to your elements/components.

```js
import { createBenefit } from "benefit"

const { styleWith } = createBenefit()

<div class={styleWith("bg-blue-400 text-black p-4")}>...</div>
```
