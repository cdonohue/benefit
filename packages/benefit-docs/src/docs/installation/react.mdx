```bash
npm i benefit-react
```

> Requires `react` >= `16.3`

You have two ways of integrating `benefit-react` into your project:

### JSX Pragma

This option requires some additional configuration, but does not require you to wrap each component that you intend to use utility classes with.

> Similar to a comment containing linter configuration, this configures the jsx babel plugin to use the `jsx` function instead of `React.createElement`.
>
> [JSX Pragma Documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#pragma)

Set the jsx pragma at the top of your source file and import the `jsx` function from `benefit-react`

```js
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "benefit-react"

export default function MyComponent() {
  return <div className="bg-blue-400 text-black p-4">...</div>
}
```

### Box component

As an alternative to the `jsx` approach, you can also import the `Box` component and use that as you would render any other component. The same example from above using a `Box` would look like the following:

```js
import { Box } from "benefit/react"

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Box is="div" className="bg-blue-400 text-black p-4">
      ...
    </Box>
  )
}
```

_The `jsx` function is really just passing all of your elements through the `Box` component and applying utility styles. It's up to you which one to use. The `jsx` pragma approach just saves you a bit of typing_
