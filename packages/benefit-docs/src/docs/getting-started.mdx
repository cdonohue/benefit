`benefit` can be consumed in a few different ways:

_Feel free to replace `yarn add` with `npm install`_

## Framework agnostic

```bash
yarn add benefit
```

```js
import { createBenefit } from "benefit"
```

`createBenefit` is a function that will return a `styleWith` property that you can call as a function. Use this when you want to output any utility classes to your elements/components.

```js
const { styleWith } = createBenefit()

<div class={styleWith("bg-blue-400 text-black p-4")}>...</div>
```

## React

```bash
yarn add benefit-react
```

Set the jsx pragma at the top of your source file where you intend to use `benefit`.

```js
/** @jsx jsx */
```

> Similar to a comment containing linter configuration, this configures the jsx babel plugin to use the `jsx` function instead of `React.createElement`.
>
> [JSX Pragma Documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#pragma)

Import the `jsx` function from `benefit`

```js
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "benefit/react"
```

```js
<div className="bg-blue-400 text-black p-4">...</div>
```

As an alternative to the `jsx` approach, you can also import the `Box` component and use that as you would render any other component. The same example from above using a `Box` would look like the following:

```js
import { Box } from "benefit/react"
```

```js
<Box is="div" className="bg-blue-400 text-black p-4">...</div>
```

_The `jsx` function is really just passing all of your elements through the `Box` component and applying utility styles. It's up to you which one to use. The `jsx` pragma approach just saves you a bit of typing_
