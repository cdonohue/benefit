`benefit` can be consumed in a few different ways:

## Framework agnostic

```bash
npm i benefit
```

## React

```bash
npm i benefit-react
```

This provides some additional wrappers and is preferred for `React` applications, but also exposes the core functionality from the framework agnostic `benefit` package.
