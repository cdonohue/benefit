> `benefit` is a utility CSS-in-JS library that provides a set of low-level, configurable, ready-to-use styles. These styles are generated for you as you use them, so you don't have to worry about including stylesheets or eliminating unused styles.

### Let's look at a quick example:

Here, we are applying 5 utility classes to a `<div>`. Click any class to remove it and try adding some new ones (like `bg-pink-400` or `italic`).

---

<Playground
  utilities={["bg-blue-500", "p-4", "text-white", "shadow", "rounded"]}
/>

As the class names are interpreted, style rules are inserted into your markup and cached for another element to take advantage of. This way, any utility only gets inserted once.

### Now, we'll start from scratch

Let's start off with an unstyled `<div>` with some alert content. The goal is for us to make this look like an error that is displayed to the user.

- First, we'll add `bg-red-800` to style the background
- Next, add `text-white`
- Add some padding with `p-4`
- Round the corners using `rounded`
- Raise the error off of the page a bit by adding `shadow-xl`

<Playground
  content={
    <>
      <Icon name="alert-circle" className="mr-2 rounded-full" /> This is an
      alert message
    </>
  }
  hiddenUtilities={["flex", "items-center"]}
/>
