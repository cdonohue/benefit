## Style web applications using generated utility classes

`benefit` is a _5Kb_, utility CSS library that is compatible with TailwindCSS.

- Small runtime
- No build step
- Element [normalization](/customization/normalize)
- Style isolation
- Fully [Customizable](/customization/overview)
- Works with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) class names out of box

And... it only inlines the CSS for the utilities that you actually use:

<Output utilityClasses={["bg-blue-500", "text-white", "p-8", "rounded"]} />
