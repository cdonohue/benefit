`benefit` ships with default color palettes. These colors are used by the default theme and are available to use when creating your own customizations. The naming pattern for each color ranges from 100 to 900 (lightest to darkest).

In the default configuration, these colors are used to generate the [Text Color](/typography/text-color), [Background Color](background/background-color), and [Border Color](border/border-color) utilities.
